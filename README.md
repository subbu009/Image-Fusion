IMPLEMENTATION OF MEDICAL IMAGE FUSION USING NEXYS A7 100t  FPGA KIT

Abstract:
This Project implements FPGA Based Image fusion technique to analyze Medical images to diagnose various diseases. For medical diagnosis, Computed Tomography (CT) provides the best information on denser tissue with less distortion. Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) provides better information on soft tissue with more distortion. With different types equipment output medical images in clinical applications, the idea of combining images from different equipment become very important .The experiments show that the method could extract useful information from combined images so that clear images are obtained. MATLAB is used to convert images into pixel-format files and to observe simulation results. To implement this paper Xilinx Vivado & VB are needed. In Xilinx Vivado, first select hardware & software components then by adding source and header files & converting into bit streams and download into Nexys A7 100t  FPGA, to obtain fused image.
